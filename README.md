# viennaPublicTransportScraper
Automated scraper of real-time public transportation data for the 'Wiener Linien'

This repository contains a little script which can be used to scrape the API of the Wiener Linien and automatically store the requested data for further analysis.

## How-to
1. Identify the stations you want to have a look at. You may use this [tool](https://till.mabe.at/rbl/), kindly provided by [Matthias  Bendel](https://mabe.at/), helping you to find the corresponding RBL id of your selected station(s).
2. Adapt the `config.yaml` and specify your favorite stations. 
3. Use the scraper with caution and respect the website owners. We do not want any (accidental) DDoS attack!
